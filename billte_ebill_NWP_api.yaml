    get:
      description: >
        This event is triggered after any billerPid registered with the
        requesting SWP has submitted a business case with an outdated, so called
        historically available email address. It notifies about the changed
        email address of a bill recipient, which has been adjusted in eBill.

        An email address is considered to be historically available if it was
        present up to 15 months prior to the submission time.

        The billers are able to submit business cases with historically
        available email addresses of a bill recipient. However, latest 15 months
        after the email address changed, the billers are required to submit the
        business cases with the currently valid email address of the bill

        recipient.

      **System Healthcheck**

      This allows to check the basic state of the system (can it be reached,
      does authentication and auhorization work, does it respond). As some
      infrastructures block certain HTTP methods by default, the healthcheck
      allows to test if all required methods (GET, POST) work across all layers.
